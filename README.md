# Camunda examples

This is an example of a simple process that generates a PDF file and send it by mail.

### Build it
The project is built with Gradle

```
gradlew build
```

### Run it
Per default, it's running on port 8082 and this can be changed in the application.properties file.
To test it, you can play with the swagger UI :

```
http://localhost:8082/swagger-ui.html
```
